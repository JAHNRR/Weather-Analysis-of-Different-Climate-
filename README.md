Program Overview:
This C program provides solutions to various queries related to climate stations in a city. The program takes input data from a CSV file and processes it to answer the queries specified in the problem statement. The queries include identifying stations with the highest heat degree days, determining thermally comfortable days for selected urban stations, listing dates for stations with decreasing vegetation density and temperatures higher than the average city temperature, identifying top stations with minimum population density and highest maximum temperature, and calculating heat island intensity for urban stations.

File Structure:

main.c: Contains the main program logic and query functions implementation.
input.csv: Input data file containing information about climate stations, urban parameters, and weather parameters.
